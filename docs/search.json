    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by driving decisions in healthcare, finance, and transportation. However, many AI systems operate as “black boxes,” raising concerns about trust, fairness, and accountability. Explainable AI (XAI) is designed to address these challenges by providing transparency and interpretability in machine learning models.\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the evolution of XAI, the tools and methods it offers, real-world applications, and the challenges we still face in achieving fully explainable AI."
